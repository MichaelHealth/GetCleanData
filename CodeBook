This codebook describes the operation and the variables of the run_analysis.R file.  The file is run from the same directory 
as the UCI HAR Dataset.  
The dataset is created from accelerometer and gyroscope data from Samsung SII's worn by 30 volunteers.  
The libraries of ddplr and reshape2 are loaded and then the training data set is loaded into traindata from X_train.txt 
and the features.txt file is loaded to create the column names.  

Two additional columns are created.  Action_ID is from the y_train.txt file and has digit from 1-6 denoting the type of activity.
Person_ID has the number of the test volunteers from the subject_train.txt.  Action_ID and PersonID are then added to the 
traindata with rbind.  

The features.txt file is used to create featureslist which is then loased into the column names of the traindata.  Finally the Action_ID and Person_ID columns are named.

The same process is repeated with the test data directory to create the testdata dataframe.  Then traindata and testdata are joined together with rbind to make bigdata.  

The Action_ID column is then converted from number 1-6 format to the descriptive activity name.  

The column names are then converted to more decriptive names with a series of gsub cammands removing -, (), and certain lower
case letters from the column names.

bigdata is then converted to DataShow and DataView with the melt and dcast commands.  
These commands use the Action_ID and Person_ID as identifiers and average all of the other readings for each column name.  

The DataView is converted to DataView.txt file with columns aligned and signoificant digits reduced to 5 to keep with 
a tidy data set.  This the output of run_analysis.R.
